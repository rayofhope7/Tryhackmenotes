1)    What is CIA triad: - 
>>>>Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are represented by the “CIA triad”’s three initials. 
A prominent model that serves as the foundation for the creation of security systems is the CIA triad. 
They are used to identify weaknesses and develop strategies for problem-solving.
>>> When all three requirements have been completed, the organization’s security profile should be stronger and more prepared to cope with threat situations.

2)    The three letters in “CIA triad” stand for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

A)    Confidentiality — Ensures that data and resources are only available to those that are authorized.
Example: I’m a customer of IDFC Bank, and I can access my account information, like my balance and transactions. 
However, I can’t review any other customer’s account or information. That is Confidentiality. 

Implemenations: All customer data is encrypted both in online transactions and stored in databases. Data Encryption — SHA-256 or Bcrypt
Access to customer financial data is restricted to authorized users only, and strong authentication methods like two-factor authentication are employed.
So Here, even if an attacker gains access to the bank’s systems, the encrypted data remains protected, and unauthorized access attempts are detected and blocked.

B)    Integrity: - In a bank you financial data is accurate and has been not altered/changed.. or suppose you do a shopping and you uses your credit card to do that shopping 
so your bankig info or credit card detailes like how much balanced do you have in your credit card should be confident and should not to disclosed or visible 
to third party vendor/application that is integrity..

Implementation: 
Data integrity checks, such as checksums and hash functions, are used to verify the integrity of data during transmission and storage.
(Checksum — Cryptographic hash is created and compared and helps ensure that your copy of the file is genuine and free from errors.)
Removes duplicates files
Digital signatures are applied to financial transactions, ensuring that they cannot be altered without detection.
So Here even any unauthorized modification of customer data or transactions is detected, then the bank can take corrective actions to maintain the accuracy and trustworthiness of the data.

Availability: - Availability focuses on the accessibility and availability of data and systems when needed.
I’m a customer of HDFC Bank, and I can access my account whenever I need to. This shows how important availability is. 
Banking should be accessible to everyone 24/7 without any difficulties because people might need money at any time.

Implementatins: 
Redundancy — Backup hardware such as servers and hard drives
The system uses load balancing and redundant servers to ensure high availability
Intrusion detection systems and firewalls are used to protect against DDoS attacks and other threats.
Continuous Monitoring— Software to monitor internet traffic and performance

Here customers can access their accounts and conduct transactions at any time without service interruptions, and the bank can quickly recover from potential disruptions.
