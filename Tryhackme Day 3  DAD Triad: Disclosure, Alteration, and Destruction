DAD Triad: -  Disclosure, Alteration, and Denial â€” represents the critical security failures that every organization must strive to prevent, and it is opposite to CIA Triad. 

1)    Disclosure: Information disclosure, often referred to as information leakage, occurs when a website inadvertently exposes sensitive data to its users. 
In various scenarios, websites can unintentionally reveal different types of information that could be exploited by potential attackers.

> Other user data 
> Company confidential documents 
> Customer financial info 
> Website technical info about its infrastructure. 

2)   Alteration: Alteration is the opposite of Integrity. An unauthorized change of information/data

3)   Denial: Denial is the opposite of Availability. 
It is done by flooding the network or server with useless and invalid authentication requests which eventually brings the whole network down, resulting in no connectivity. 
As a result of this, users are prevented from using a service.
