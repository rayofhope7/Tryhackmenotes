1)   Bell-LaPadula Model: - 
The Bell-LaPadula Model is a confidentiality policy

A)   Simple Security Condition (No Reads Up):- 
It states that a subject at a lower security level cannot read an object at a higher security level. 
This rule prevents access to sensitive information above the authorized level.

B)   Property (Star Property) (No Writes Down): - 
it states that a subject at a higher security level cannot write to an object at a lower security level. 
This rule prevents the disclosure of sensitive information to a subject of lower security level.

2)   Biba Model: -  
Data Integrity Policy

A)   Simple Security Property (No Reads down):- 
A higher integrity subject should not read from a lower integrity object.

B)   Property (Star Property) (No Writes Up): - 
A lower integrity subject should not write to a higher integrity object.

3)   Clark-Wilson Model: -  Information Integrity & Access Proccess 
The security model states that the system should maintain consistency between internal and external data and that only authorized users 
should be able to generate and alter dataâ€”unauthorized users should not be able to do so at all.

Constrained Data Item (CDI): This refers to the data type whose integrity we want to preserve.
Unconstrained Data Item (UDI): This refers to all data types beyond CDI, such as user and system input.
Transformation Procedures (TPs): These procedures are programmed operations, such as read and write, and should maintain the integrity of CDIs.
Integrity Verification Procedures (IVPs): These procedures check and ensure the validity of CDIs.
